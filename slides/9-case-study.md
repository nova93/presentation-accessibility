## Apple

Over Apple’s history, there have been several moments when the company went out of its way to improve product accessibility. Each time, it turned out to be a wise decision from both a business and UX standpoint.

One instance happened in the early 2000s, when the California State University system was unable to take advantage of Apple’s iTunes U educational program. The university could not use the program because it was not fully accessible for blind students. After listening to their concerns, Apple took steps to fix the issue, and the university was able to implement the program.

A second example occurred when developing the iPhone. Apple’s team realized that using a touchscreen device might be difficult for blind customers, and developed the VoiceOver screen reader in response. The screen reader was popular and earned Apple a commendation from the US National Federation of the Blind.
